## Hook
the day and night cycle, it's such a beautiful thing to watch. They are the very opposite of each other, fighting to take each other place. Yet they are just two sides of the same coin. Such a mysterious concept is being shown in a game made by you truly.

Also, get slides animation if time left
## Product
If (I can't show my code or game online)then I will have to show it -through a video or gif
if (possible)

-find a way to make it available online like itch.io(maybe?)

-show tools-unity

-tell them the basic idea of what unity is.


-Show my MVP,
-describe what is it supposed to happen:
the camera movement, the player movement, the animation, projectiles, the day and night cycle, if possible the NPCs.
## Process


_My code is supposed to be divided in class, so show what each class does.

show the code of the place where I get stuck for a long time.

If I can't remember my previous code to revert it, describe it.


-What my after-MVP thoughts are like?

-explain what I think needs to be changed, why and how I thought that

the code was like, and any challenges


## Conclusion
-give them a like to try for themselves if I'm able to find a way to put it online.


-say thank you


-(maybe, just maybe) ask for support, if they want to see this project make it online and expand upon.
