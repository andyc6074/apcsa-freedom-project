## What's happening
We haved finish our mvp now and has presntented. I will now be talking about my takeaways and what was the issues.

## Issues

The main issue was I that was not perpare enough, I didn't know what I was going to say well enough. Even if I know what I was going to so I didn't pratice enough to propurly say my intentation with the word in mind. I talk way to quiet, causeing the judge to not hear what I was going to say. A lot of the mumbling and nervous laughter cause then to think not much of me.

## Takeaways-both
1. Try to plan your words before time so you won't be so out of place due to youself not being ready enough to say what you want to say.
2. pratice before the day you present has come.
3. try to not show you are nervese even tough the inside you are.
4. try no to self-deprecate publicly.

## takeaways- Expo elevator pitch
I think one thing I could fix is how I persent my info, I need to show them what flasy feature to draw their intentation, say what I use, and what I did after.

## takeaways- in-class presentation
What I think I need to do is to fix my slides, There was bit too mcuh text. put less.
