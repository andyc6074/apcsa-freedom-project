## What's happening
We have finished our MVP now and have presented. I will now be talking about my takeaways and what the issues were.


## Issues


The main issue was that I was not prepared enough, I didn't know what I was going to say well enough. Even though I knew what I was going to do, I didn't practice enough to properly say my intention with the word in mind. I talk way too quiet, causing the judge to not hear what I was going to say. A lot of the mumbling and nervous laughter cause them to not think much of me.


## Takeaways-both
1. Try to plan your words before time so you won't be so out of place due to yourself not being ready enough to say what you want to say.
2. practice before the day you present has come.
3. try to not show you are nervous even though you are inside.
4. try no to self-deprecate publicly.


## takeaways- Expo elevator pitch
I think one thing I could fix is how I present my info. I need to show them what interesting features to draw their attention, say what I use, and what I did after.


## takeaways- in-class presentation
What I think I need to do is to fix my slides. There was a bit too much text. put less.
