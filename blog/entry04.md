### Context
As I have been learning my tool for some time. I have spent a bit of time deciding on what type of game I should work on and what are the mechanics. After sitting down and thinking for a while, I have no luck in deciding on what the type is, however, the mechanic is more straightforward for me. I want my game to be based on light and shadow, "day" and "night" modes. Ok, past the general planning, I will be talking about the tinkering.

### How have I been learning
The way I learn a new feature is by looking at tutorials or any forms, which could be videos or websites. I follow through the steps then I change the value to see what has changed and what else affects what.
