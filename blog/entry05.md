## What's happening
We haved finish our mvp now. I have work on unity as my game, right now all I have is just a scenic game, It not yet the best it cn be but it's still something. I will now tell you the prouss trought out my mvp.

## Set-up
---
## 1: buliding the map
In order to build in unity, you can either download blender, create your prop, then imported to your unity or build directly in unity. To build dircety in blender you will have to download and import ProBuilder(go to Service on the top bar in unity, then click explore, then type and import Pr0Builder). With Probuilder, you can add object of varies shape wihich can be furter customized.
I heard it's recomended to build the terain in unity, and add in the smaller deatail with blender models.

I don't need to explain the whole build prouses so I will just say the important part. I use preface on reppetive block, use edge selection to create new shape/details.

## 2: Getting models
Unless you want a cube as your player you would need to make or download a model. I'm not a good modeler so I just download the model from unity asset page.

After you imported the model, you will have to set to humanoid in Rig section.

## 3: extra
Adding a charater controler will make the object move.
