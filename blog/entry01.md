This is the beginning of the APCSA Freedom Project. My tool is ml5 but in order to make an AI in a game, I would need a game in the first place. While could use another game, I feel like that is too limiting, and just decided to use Unity (https://unity.com/) to create a base game. Needing Unity to create my base game, I decided to watch a few tutorials, both for 2d and 3d games. This way I can get a few of which styles I wanted to focus on. As for what I think, I mess around by looking at the basics of unity, opening up the unity hub and creating a project. Through watching I have learned that in the 2D project, there is the project, where you hold the file, the hierarchy containing everything in the current scene, The scene itself, and the inspector, where you can change the value of the object. Through utilizing these four panels, a start of a flappy bird game.

### EDP/engineering design process
Right now, I am around stage 3. Plan the most promising solution, Eight now we are learning our tools, tinkering with them, and just planning our next step. I think I am going to continue to quickly learn unity and decide on what style to do then move on to learn ml5.

### Skills
I have learned how to pick on what option is better and what resources to use.
I have learned what part to closely read and what part just to skim through.
