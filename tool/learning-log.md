I have installed Unity and watched videos to understand Unity to create my base game. I also created a new small project to see and get used to the UI, I only worked on the 2D section so far, before I went on to the 3D version. What I made is a terrible version of Flappy Bird.

*The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t)
*How to make a Video Game playlist-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6&index=1)
Right now I am tinkering with my too, I am going to tinker with my tools. I think I will continue to quickly learn unity and decide on what style to do then move on to learn ml5. 
The next thing to do is to work on the 3d side of unity and see what to do afterward -after adding a finishing touch to the 2d side-.

*following along I learned about the physics system and I had tinkered with the physics system in the game.

*I learned about how frames affect physics and I have to use Time.deltaTime to fix that issue.

*I learned about how to create a script and add it to Unity. The script's language is C#.

*I learn how variables can be used so we can modify the value in the unity interface itself.
