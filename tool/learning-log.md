I have installed Unity and watched videos to understand Unity to create my base game. I also created a new small project to see and get used to the UI, I only worked on the 2D section so far, before I went on to the 3D version. What I made is a terrible version of Flappy Bird.

*The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t)
*How to make a Video Game playlist-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6&index=1)
Right now I am tinkering with my too, I am going to tinker with my tools. I think I will continue to quickly learn unity and decide on what style to do then move on to learn ml5.
The next thing to do is to work on the 3d side of unity and see what to do afterward -after adding a finishing touch to the 2d side-.

*following along I learned about the physics system and I had tinkered with the physics system in the game.

 *I learned about how frames affect physics and I have to use Time.deltaTime to fix that issue.

* I learned about how to create a script and add it to Unity. The script's language is C#.

* I learned how variables can be used so we can modify the value in the unity interface itself.

* I learn how to assign player movement

I had worked on the gameplay feature of my learning ground game. I watch tutorials to see what to do.
* Drag an object from the hierarchy to create a prefab
* Prefabs are used if you want to use multiple of the same object at the same time
* if you affect one prefab object, each of the same objects will change along with it. (Remember to apply when changing something on the prefab.)
* you can click on the axis on the top left, to align your camera to that axis.
* if you to snap to a grid, you go to edit and click snapsetting, and it will open a menu, if you put 2,2,2 in the first two boxes, the object will snap to every two grid spaces.
* speed build up, so when changing the direction you will need to build up enough for to first do so.
* add fog to remove player visibility. (increase suspense and general attention)
* looking into Blender and how to sculpt using Blender.

I tested around the game feature a bit.
* make sure to organize the file into a folder. an example: putting a script file into a script folder
* to make sure the player doesn't phase through other entities, selecting continuous under collision
* decrease the fixed time so the game will update freely, making sure to fix part of the  script that uses the fixed time.
* to create a UI, you would create it the same way as any object.
* select ui, slect text
* slect text, the 2d mode
